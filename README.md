# How to Install the Extension

### Creating Icons

You'll need to create icon files in these sizes: 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128. Place them in an "icons" directory. You can create simple icons using any image editor or icon generator. Below is how to create the icons directory:

1. Create all the files as described above
2. Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/
3. Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the top-right corner
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select your /Users/jamie.wallace/Sites/Bright/font-usage-check directory
5. The extension should now appear in your extensions list
6. Click the extension icon in your toolbar to use it on any webpage
